# Tech interview questions

This is a repo of tech interview questions I've actually received, and questions that colleagues have received. I've included my solutions in the example_solutions directory.

I haven't generally received feedback on my solutions, so please don't take them as a source of truth. Your solutions may be equally valid, just different. 

# General tech interview advice

These questions run the gamut from traditional data structures and algorithms-style questions (Hop-Skip-Jump) to practical programming (Mailgun API integration) to just random tasks to see if you have a general idea of programming principles and communication (Make a Calendar). 

For in-person questions, generally try to timebox yourself to around half an hour. Take-home should not take more than eight hours, ideally fewer. 

The most important component of a technical interview, is the interviewer. You can fail to solve a problem in the allotted time (I have multiple times), but if you are able to communicate your problem solving strategies, ask intelligent questions, and reach out for help gracefully, you will still pass. Every interview, even the "technical" interview, is ultimately a vibe check. Because the human component is so important, it's best to practice these with someone else - my mentor gave me multiple mock technical interviews over a few days. 

If you don't finish in the allotted time, make sure to finish out the problem and send it to your interviewer later. 

You should be able to demonstrate your answer is correct. That can be with an existing test suite, one that you create yourself, or through printing to the terminal. Try to consider edge cases.
